    "To conduct an F-test to determine if the variances of two populations are equal or not, \n",
    "we need to compare the sample variances using an F-test. The null hypothesis\n",
    "for this F-test is that the population variances are equal, and the alternative\n",
    "hypothesis is that they are not equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's denote the sample variances as s1^2 and s2^2, and the corresponding sample \n",
    "sizes as n1 = 10 and n2 = 15. We need to calculate the F-statistic as:\n",
    "\n",
    "F = s1^2 / s2^2\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the null hypothesis, the F-statistic follows an F-distribution with (n1-1) = 9 \n",
    "degrees of freedom in the numerator and (n2-1) = 14 degrees of freedom in the denominator.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether the population variances are significantly different\n",
    "at a 10% significance level, we need to compare the calculated F-value\n",
    "with the critical value from the F-distribution table. \n",
    "The critical value is obtained from the F-distribution table with 9 degrees of freedom \n",
    "in the numerator and 14 degrees of freedom in the denominator, and a significance level of 10%.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the F-distribution table, we find that the critical value of \n",
    "F at a 10% significance level with 9 and 14 degrees of freedom is 2.47.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can calculate the F-statistic:\n",
    "\n",
    "F = s1^2 / s2^2 = 25 / 20 = 1.25\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the calculated F-value (1.25) is less than the \n",
    "critical value of F (2.47), we fail to reject the null \n",
    "hypothesis. Therefore, we can conclude that there is not \n",
    "enough evidence to suggest that the population variances \n",
    "are significantly different at a 10% significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we cannot say for sure that the variances of\n",
    "the two populations are different based on the samples collected."
