    "To conduct an F-test to determine if the variance of a population is equal\n",
    "to a specific value, we need to compare the sample variance to the\n",
    "hypothesized population variance. The null hypothesis for this F-test \n",
    "is that the population variance is equal to 0.005, and the alternative \n",
    "hypothesis is that it is not equal to 0.005.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's denote the population variance as σ^2 and the sample\n",
    "variance as s^2. We have a sample size of n = 25, with a \n",
    "sample variance of s^2 = 0.006. The F-statistic is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "F = s^2 / σ^2\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the null hypothesis, the F-statistic follows \n",
    "an F-distribution with (n - 1) = 24 degrees of freedom \n",
    "in the numerator and an infinite number of degrees of freedom in the denominator.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether the population variance is \n",
    "significantly different from 0.005 at a 1% significance level, \n",
    "we need to compare the calculated F-value with the critical value \n",
    "from the F-distribution table. The critical value is obtained from \n",
    "the F-distribution table with 24 degrees of freedom in the numerator \n",
    "and an infinite number of degrees of freedom in the denominator, and \n",
    "a significance level of 1%.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the F-distribution table, we find that the critical value\n",
    "of F at a 1% significance level with 24 and infinite degrees of freedom is 0.116.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can calculate the F-statistic:\n",
    "\n",
    "F = s^2 / σ^2 = 0.006 / 0.005 = 1.2\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the calculated F-value (1.2) is greater than \n",
    "the critical value of F (0.116), we reject the null\n",
    "hypothesis. Therefore, we can conclude that the population \n",
    "variance is significantly different from 0.005 at a 1% significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, there is enough evidence to suggest that the\n",
    "population variance is different from 0.005 based on the sample collected."
